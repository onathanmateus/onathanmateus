## üëã About Me:
HELLO WORLD üòÅ!!! <br> <p>My name is Nathan Mateus and my goal is to make the world of computing as accessible as possible to the end consumer through technical tools that allow them to have an unforgettable experience! <br> At the moment I am studying TYPESCRIPT/REACT.JS and BOOTSTRAP (I already have experience with HTML5, CSS3, Git/Github and also with design tools such as Figma and Gimp) and I intend to study REACT NATIVE, all the time I am studying and creating practical projects in order to improve learning (all of them are available on my Github profile), my will to learn is insatiable, studying programming for me is everything, I am a person totally dedicated to what I believe and never give up on my dreams, I love working in teams and I am calm and can manage the storms that occur on a daily basis.</p>
