## 👋 About Me:
HELLO WORLD 😁!!! <br> <p>My name is Nathan Mateus and my goal is to make the world of computing as accessible as possible to the end consumer through technical tools that allow them to have an unforgettable experience!</p> <p>I am currently studying JAVASCRIPT (Advanced) and TYPESCRIPT in order to specialise further before moving on to REACT.JS (I already have experience in HTML5, CSS3, BOOTSTRAP, TAILWIND, REACT. JS (Basic), JAVA, GIT / GITHUB and also with design tools, such as FIGMA and GIMP) and I intend in the near future to study REACT NATIVE, all the time I am studying and creating practical projects in order to improve learning (all of them are available on my Github profile).</p> <p>My desire to learn is insatiable, studying programming for me is everything, I am a person totally dedicated to what I believe in and I never give up on my dreams, I love working in a team besides being calm and being able to manage the storms that occur on a daily basis.</p>
